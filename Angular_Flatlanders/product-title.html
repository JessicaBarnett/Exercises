<!--to use includes: 

	add   
		ng-include="'product-title.html'"   
	to the direct parent of the elements you want to extract.

	note the double and single quotes.  ng-include is expecting a string as input.  that's why we need both.

	ng-include does an ajax request to pull the include file down when the button is clicked
